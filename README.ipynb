    "* why tuples and dataclasses?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Tuples are natural in Python for quickly grouping together return results.\n",
    "  `NamedTuple` and `dataclass` specifically provide a very straighforward and self documenting way way to represent a bit of data in Python.\n",
    "  Very compact syntax makes it extremely convenitent even for one-off means of communicating between couple of functions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  * TODO [2019-07-30 Tue 21:02] some link to data class\n",
    "    \n",
    "* why not [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Pickling is a bit heavyweight for plain data class. There are many reports of pickle being slower than even JSON and it's also security risk. Lastly, it can only be loaded via Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* why `sqlite` database for storage?\n",
    "\n",
    "  It's pretty effecient and sequence of namedtuples maps onto database rows in a very straighforward manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* why not `pandas.DataFrame`?\n",
    "\n",
    "  DataFrames are great and can be serialised to csv or pickled.\n",
    "  They are good to have as one of the ways you can interface with your data, however hardly convenitent to think about it abstractly due to their dynamic nature.\n",
    "  They also can't be nested.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* why not [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ORMs tend to be pretty invasive, which might complicate your scripts or even ruin performance. It's also somewhat an overkill for such a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * E.g. [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping) requires you using custom sqlalchemy specific types and inheriting a base class.\n",
    "    Also it doesn't support nested types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* why not [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/nesting.html)?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Marshmallow is a common way to map data into db-friendly format, but it requires explicit schema which is an overhead when you have it already in the form of type annotations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *  https://github.com/justanr/marshmallow-annotations TODO has support for NamedTuples\n",
